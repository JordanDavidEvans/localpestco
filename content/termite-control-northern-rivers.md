## Local Termite Expertise

Termites thrive in the warm, humid conditions of the Northern Rivers. I focus on early detection and prevention to protect timber homes from costly damage.

## Signs of Termites in Northern Rivers Homes

- Mud tubes along foundations and walls
- Soft or hollow-sounding timber
- Discarded wings near windowsills

## NSW Licensing & Regulations

All termite work in New South Wales must be carried out by licensed professionals. I hold the required pest management technician licence issued by the NSW Environment Protection Authority ([EPA NSW](https://www.epa.nsw.gov.au/your-environment/pesticides/licences-and-permits/pest-management-technicians-and-businesses)).

For homeowners, NSW Fair Trading provides guidance on engaging accredited pest controllers and understanding treatment options ([NSW Fair Trading - Pest Management](https://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/housing-and-property/building-and-renovating/pest-management)).
