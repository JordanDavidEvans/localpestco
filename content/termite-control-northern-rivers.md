## Local Termite Expertise

Termites thrive in the warm, humid conditions of the Northern Rivers. I focus on early detection and prevention to protect timber homes from costly damage.

## Signs of Termites in Northern Rivers Homes

- Mud tubes along foundations and walls
- Soft or hollow-sounding timber
- Discarded wings near windowsills

## NSW Licensing & Regulations

All termite work in New South Wales must be carried out by licensed professionals. I hold NSW EPA pest management technician licence number 5073077 ([EPA NSW](https://www.epa.nsw.gov.au/Your-environment/Pesticides/Licences-and-advice-for-occupational-pesticide-users/pest-management-technicians-fumigators-training-permits)), issued 20/02/2025 and valid until 14/01/2030.

For homeowners, the EPA provides guidance on engaging accredited pest controllers and understanding treatment options ([EPA - Engaging a Pest Management Technician](https://www.epa.nsw.gov.au/Your-environment/Pesticides/pesticide-use-nsw/engaging-a-pest-management-technician)).
