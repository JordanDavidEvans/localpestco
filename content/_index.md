[[faq]]
question = "Is your pest control safe for kids and pets?"
answer = "Yes. I use targeted, low-tox options and explain what each product does. I ask you to cover food bowls and toys before I start. Once areas are dry, kids and pets can return as normal."

[[faq]]
question = "How soon can you visit my place?"
answer = "Most Kingscliff and Tweed Coast jobs happen the same or next day. I confirm timing when you call or email. If weather slows things down, I keep you updated. You will know the plan before I arrive."

[[faq]]
question = "Do you handle termites?"
answer = "Yes, I provide termite inspections, treatments, and follow-up plans. I hold NSW EPA pest licence 5073077 for timber pests. I explain any treatment zones in plain language. You also get written notes after the visit."

[[faq]]
question = "Is there a service warranty?"
answer = "My work includes a service warranty tailored to the pest. I explain how long the coverage lasts before treatment begins. If pests return during that period, I come back at no labour cost. We set future check-ins where needed."

[[faq]]
question = "What should I do before you arrive?"
answer = "Please tidy access to affected rooms and move pets to a safe area. I bring everything else needed for treatment. Let me know about allergies or concerns before the visit. That helps me choose the right products."

## What we treat

I manage termites, rodents, ants, spiders, cockroaches, and other common Northern Rivers pests for homes and workplaces. See the full list on our [Services page](/services/).

### How it works

1. Inspect – I check entry points, moisture, and pest activity.
2. Treat – I apply targeted products suited to your property.
3. Protect – I share prevention tips and set up monitoring if needed.
4. Follow up – I confirm results and schedule future checks when required.

I look after Kingscliff, Casuarina, Cabarita Beach, Chinderah, Cudgen, Fingal Head, Pottsville, and nearby Tweed Heads communities. See more detail on our [Locations page](/locations/). Prefer to chat? Call 0405 508 035.

## Caring for Country in our work

Caring for Country guides every visit: I respect the land, waterways, and people who live here. I assess each site, choose targeted treatments, and avoid harm to non-target species. Clients notice clear explanations, tidy work, and tips to prevent pests long term. [Read more about our approach](/about/).
