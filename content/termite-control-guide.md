We share what we’ve learnt keeping homes termite-free on the Tweed Coast. Our team explains the signs, treatment options and costs so you can choose what suits your place.

## Signs of termites

Look for hollow timber, mud tubes and discarded wings around your property.

## Inspection cadence

We suggest yearly checks, and after heavy rain or renovations.

## Baiting vs barriers

Baiting lets us monitor colonies, while chemical barriers block entry. We assess and recommend the best fit.

## Costs and timeframes

Minor baiting jobs start from $1,100. Full perimeter barriers can take two days and start from $2,200.

## Seasonal advice

Termites stay active year-round in our climate. Keep gardens tidy and drainage clear.
