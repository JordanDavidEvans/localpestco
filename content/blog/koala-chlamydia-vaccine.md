Australia has approved the first nationwide rollout of a koala chlamydia vaccine, a breakthrough that could help reverse the species' decline. Developed by the University of the Sunshine Coast (UniSC), the single-dose vaccine reduces chlamydia-related mortality in wild populations by at least 65% while preventing debilitating symptoms during breeding age [^abc].

## Why koalas need urgent protection

Koalas across Queensland, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory were listed as endangered in 2022. South-east Queensland's wild population has dropped below 16,000 due to habitat loss, vehicle strikes, dog attacks and widespread chlamydia infections [^abc]. Recent research underscores how disease and environmental pressures together are pushing the species toward extinction [^nature].

## What the vaccine means for conservation

The UniSC vaccine's single-dose design makes it practical for use in the wild, unlike two-dose alternatives. Researchers and conservation groups are urging government support to deliver the vaccine to at-risk koala populations in Queensland and New South Wales by the end of 2026 [^abc]. A successful rollout could turn the tide for struggling colonies and keep this iconic marsupial on the landscape for generations.
