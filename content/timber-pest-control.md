Protect the structure of your home or business with thorough timber pest inspections that identify termites, borers, and fungal decay before they spread.

## What Is Timber Pest Control?

Timber pests such as termites, borers and fungal decay attack the wooden structures that keep your property standing. Timber pest control involves inspecting, treating and monitoring for these destructive organisms so they do not compromise your home or business.

## Why Licensing Matters

Timber pest management requires specialised knowledge of building construction, pest biology and safe application of termiticides. In New South Wales, a professional license ensures the operator has the training and insurance to protect your property. Hiring a licensed technician shields you from ineffective treatments and costly structural damage.
