Possums are protected wildlife in New South Wales, so removal must be handled by licensed specialists who follow relocation rules and respect the animals.

## NSW Possum Laws

In New South Wales, possums are protected. The National Parks and Wildlife Act requires that:

- Only licensed wildlife handlers may capture possums.
- Trapped possums must be released on the same property within 50 metres of where they were caught.
- Relocation or harm without a permit is illegal.
