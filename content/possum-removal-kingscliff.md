## NSW Possum Laws

In New South Wales, possums are protected. The National Parks and Wildlife Act requires that:

- Only licensed wildlife handlers may capture possums.
- Trapped possums must be released on the same property within 50 metres of where they were caught.
- Relocation or harm without a permit is illegal.

For more detail, see the [NSW Department of Planning and Environment](https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/topics/animals-and-plants/native-animals/native-animal-facts/possum) guidelines.
