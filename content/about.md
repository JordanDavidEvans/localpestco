Local Pest Co is a Wiradjuri and Bundjalung owned business delivering licensed pest management with respect for Country and community.

## Our Story

Founded and operated by me, an *Aboriginal* local, **Local Pest Co** combines my community knowledge with licensed pest management techniques for Kingscliff and surrounding suburbs. I focus on safe methods that respect families, pets, and the environment while keeping Tweed Coast homes pest-free.

### Meet Shannon Kitchener

Shannon Kitchener is an avid fly fisher who explores regional parts of Australia, building connections with Country and its Traditional Owners. When he isn't on the water, Shannon paints traditional art—the same vibrant style featured in our banner. He also runs **[X-stream Fly Sportfishing Tours](https://www.facebook.com/xstreamfly/)**, sharing his love of angling with others.
