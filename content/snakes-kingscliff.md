Snakes occasionally pass through Kingscliff yards, so knowing who to call and how to stay calm keeps families, pets, and wildlife safe.

## Snakes in the Neighbourhood

Kingscliff backs onto bush and wetlands, so snakes wander through from time to time. You'll usually see carpet pythons or green tree snakes sunning themselves, but a red-bellied black snake isn't unheard of.

If you spot one, resist the urge to play hero. Snakes move on if left alone and they're protected wildlife in New South Wales.

## Spotting Local Species

A few quick IDs for curious locals:

- **Carpet python** – large, non-venomous and fond of roof spaces.
- **Green tree snake** – bright, harmless and fast.
- **Red-bellied black snake** – venomous but shy; usually near creeks.

If you're ever unsure, snap a photo from a safe distance and send it to a catcher for ID.
