## FAQs
**Is your pest control safe for kids and pets?**  
Yes. I use targeted, low-tox options and explain what each product does. Please cover food bowls and toys before I start. Once areas are dry, kids and pets can return as normal.

**How soon can you visit my place?**  
Most jobs happen the same or next day. I’ll confirm timing when you call or email. If weather slows things down, I’ll keep you updated.

**Do you handle termites?**  
Yes — inspections, treatments and follow-up plans. NSW EPA licence 5073077 (timber pests). I’ll explain any treatment zones in plain language and provide written notes after the visit.

**Is there a service warranty?**  
Yes — tailored to the pest. I’ll explain coverage length before treatment. If pests return during that period, I come back at no labour cost.

**What should I do before you arrive?**  
Tidy access to affected rooms and move pets to a safe area. Let me know about allergies or concerns beforehand so I can choose the right products.
