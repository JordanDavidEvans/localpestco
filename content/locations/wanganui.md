[[faq]]
question = "Is your pest control safe for kids and pets?"
answer = "Yes. I use targeted, low-tox options and explain what each product does. Please cover food bowls and toys before I start. Once areas are dry, kids and pets can return as normal."

[[faq]]
question = "How soon can you visit my place?"
answer = "Bookings are slotted into my existing run so I can cover the region efficiently. I’ll confirm the first available time when you call or email and keep you updated if weather or other jobs shift the plan."

[[faq]]
question = "Do you handle termites?"
answer = "Yes — inspections, treatments and follow-up plans. NSW EPA licence 5073077 (timber pests). I’ll explain any treatment zones in plain language and provide written notes after the visit."

[[faq]]
question = "Is there a service warranty?"
answer = "Yes — tailored to the pest. I’ll explain coverage length before treatment. If pests return during that period, I come back at no labour cost."

question = "What should I do before you arrive?"
answer = "Tidy access to affected rooms and move pets to a safe area. Let me know about allergies or concerns beforehand so I can choose the right products."
