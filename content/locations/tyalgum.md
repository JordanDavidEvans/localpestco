question = "Is your pest control safe for kids and pets?"
answer = "Yes. I use targeted, low-tox options and explain what each product does. Please cover food bowls and toys before I start. Once areas are dry, kids and pets can return as normal."

question = "How soon can you visit my place?"
answer = "Bookings are slotted into my existing run so I can cover the region efficiently. I’ll confirm the first available time when you call or email and keep you updated if weather or other jobs shift the plan."

[[faq]]
question = "Do you handle termites?"
answer = "Yes — inspections, treatments and follow-up plans. NSW EPA licence 5073077 (timber pests). I’ll explain any treatment zones in plain language and provide written notes after the visit."

[[faq]]
question = "Is there a service warranty?"
answer = "Yes — tailored to the pest. I’ll explain coverage length before treatment. If pests return during that period, I come back at no labour cost."
