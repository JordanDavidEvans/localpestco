    <h2>Booking &amp; Service Frequency</h2>
    <p>Work is booked into existing service runs so I can cover each area efficiently, which means it isn&rsquo;t always possible to attend the very next day. I&rsquo;ll confirm the first available appointment and keep you posted if weather or other jobs shift the schedule.</p>
    <p>One-off treatments are possible when the timetable allows, yet most clients save money with planned follow-up visits that stop pests from re-establishing and reduce the need for heavier treatments later.</p>
